    <h3 id="_wx_wxWidgets_Compiles">wxWidgets Compiles</h3>

    <p>
        For all platforms use wxWidgets 3.0 and higher. AStyleWx will NOT compile with wxWidgets 2.8.</p>
    <p>
        AStyleWx expects a Unicode, non-Monolithic build. This is the default for WxWidgets 3.0 and higher and is usually
        the default for the Linux wxWidgets installation packages.</p>

    <h4 id="_wx_Linux">Linux</h4>

    <p>
        On Linux, wxWidgets is available as installation packages. AStyleWx will work with the available packages if
        wxWidgets 3.0 or higher is used. You can install both versions 2.8 and 3.0 on the same system. Both the development
        packages and the run-time packages should be installed.</p>
    <p>
        The Linux compiles use the wx-config script for information about wxWidgets. The
        default release is used unless
        another is requested. Install locations, as well as compiler and linker options, are also obtained from the
        script.</p>
    <p>
        <strong>If more than one wxWidgets distribution is installed, the default distribution to use for compiles can be
            selected with the Linux update&#8209;alternatives utility.</strong> Changing the default requires administrative
        priviledges. Use the command &quot;update&#8209;alternatives &#8209;&#8209;config wx&#8209;config&quot;. A 
        menu will be displayed showing the installations for selection. Compile options are also available as 
        described in the following Linux CMake and Makefile descriptions.</p>
    <p>
        To display the default release:</p>
    <pre>wx-config --release</pre>
    <p>
        To display a list of all installed releases:</p>
    <pre>wx-config --list</pre>
    <p>
        To display the compiler options:</p>
    <pre>wx-config --cflags</pre>
    <p>
        To display the linker options:</p>
    <pre>wx-config --libs</pre>
    <p>
        To get a list of other options:</p>
    <pre> wx-config --help</pre>

    <h4 id="_wx_MacOS">MacOS</h4>

    <p>
        <b>Use wxWidgets 3.1 or higher.</b> Previous versions did not work with C++11. For MacOS it must be compiled and
        installed from the source code. For Artistic Style Wx version 3.0 it must be compiled as C++11. Download the source
        for Linux and MacOS. Do NOT use a Windows download. It will have the wrong line endings which will cause problems.
    </p>
    <p>
        Build the library for cocoa. Install instructions are in wxWidgets docs/osx. Either Xcode or the command line
        tools may be used. The Xcode install did NOT do a complete install with the tested release. The command line tools
        were the better choice. The AStyleWx compiles are built with wxWidgets STATIC libraries from the default install
        folders.</p>
    <p>
        Building with C++11 requires additional options. The following instructions worked on a macOS 10.12 Sierra with
        wxWidgets 3.1.0. Other possible configure flags are at
        <a href="http://wiki.wxwidgets.org/Possible_Configure_Flags_under_OS_X" target="_blank"
            title="open new window">http://wiki.wxwidgets.org/Possible_Configure_Flags_under_OS_X</a></p>
    <p>
        <strong>NOTE:</strong> The following configure statement is three lines long for readability. It should be
        entered as one line. The files are built as static libraries (disable-shared). The option gnu++11 MUST be used
        instead of c++11 or linker errors will occur. The minimum deployment is macOS 10.9 Mavericks. The Clang
        compiler is used instead of the default GCC.</p>
    <p>
        To build and install static libraries using the command line: </p>

    <pre>cd wxWxdgets-3.1.0
mkdir build-release
cd build-release
../configure  --disable-shared  -with-macosx-version-min=10.9  CC=clang  CXX=clang++ \
CXXFLAGS="-std=gnu++11 -stdlib=libc++"  OBJCXXFLAGS="-std=gnu++11 -stdlib=libc++" \
LDFLAGS="-stdlib=libc++"
make
sudo make install</pre>

    <p>
        <strong>NOTE:</strong> An error may occur when compiling and installing QTKit. If it does, just re-execute the
        make using the additional option --ignore-errors e.g. "make --ignore-errors". The make will continue from
        that point. The project that does not compile is not needed. </p>
    <p>
        The Artistic Style Wx compiles use the &quot;wx-config&quot; script for information about wxWidgets. The default
        release is used unless another is requested. Install locations, as well as compiler and linker options, are also
        obtained from the script. A brief description of the script is in the <a href="#_wx_Linux">wxWidgets Linux</a>
        description.</p>

    <h4 id="_wx_Visual_Studio">Visual Studio</h4>

    <p>
        There are Visual Studio solution files for wxWidgets releases in the wxWidgets build\msw folder. All of the
        configurations and platforms in the wxWidgets solution files are supported by AStyleWx. Just open the appropriate
        solution file for your Visual Studio version and compile the configurations and platforms you want. The
        outputs will be in the various wxWidgets &quot;lib&quot; folders.</p>
    <p>
        The wxWidgets website has binary DLLs available for download. These were not used because the wxWidgets
        static libraries are not included. The binary DLLs can be used for the DLL files if you want, but the AStyleWx
        properties will need to be changed to the correct directories. The binaries are apparently compiled with the options
        OFFICIAL_BUILD, COMPILER_VERSION, and TARGET_CPU (and possibly others) while the solution file compiles are not.
        The properties that require changing are &quot;C/C++ &gt; General &gt; Additional Include Directories&quot; and
        &quot;Linker &gt; General &gt; Additional Library Directories&quot;. This may change, of course, with later
        versions.</p>
    <p>
        Compiling wxWidgets 3.0.2 with Visual Studio 2015 requires making changes to the wxWidgets source files. A
        description of the solution is at <a href="https://forums.wxwidgets.org/viewtopic.php?f=19&amp;t=40491"
            target="_blank" title="open new window">https://forums.wxwidgets.org/viewtopic.php?f=19&amp;t=40491</a>.
        Use the reply by doublemax tagged as [SOLVED]. These changes are NOT needed for wxWidgets 3.1.0 and
        higher.</p>
    <p>
        AStyleWx has a &quot;static&quot; build which is not available with the wxWidgets solutions. The Visual Studio
        wxWidgets project files can be modified by using the procedure described in the AStyleWx documentation
        <a href="static.html" target="_blank" title="open new window">Visual Studio Static Compile</a>.</p>

    <h4 id="_wx_Other_Windows_Compilers">Other Windows Compilers</h4>

    <p>
        Other Windows compilers will need to use the makefiles in the wxWidgets build\msw folder. With wxWidgets
        3 you can use the default options with the following exceptions. To build the wxWidgets static libraries no additional
        options are needed. To build the wxWidgets DLLs the option SHARED=1 should be used.</p>
    <p>
        Some compilers require compiling wxWidgets with C++11. If you need to compile with C++11, there is an important
        note in wxWidgets docs\msw\install.txt. <strong>Use &#8209;std=gnu++11 instead of &#8209;std=c++11</strong> because
        the latter disables some extensions that wxWidgets relies on. If this is not done the linker will fail with undefined
        references. &#8209;Wno-deprecated-declarations may also be needed to eliminate unwanted warning messages.</p>
    <p>
        To build wxWidgets DLLs with the TDM GCC compiler:</p>
    <pre>cd build\msw
mingw32-make -f makefile.gcc SHARED=1 CXXFLAGS=&quot;-std=gnu++11 -Wno-deprecated-declarations&quot;</pre>

    <h4 id="_CodeBlocks_Linux">CodeBlocks Linux</h4>

    <p>
        There are build folders for the following compilers. All compiler folders are in the &quot;build&quot; directory.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>cb-clang</strong> contains the workspace and project files for the Linux Clang Compiler.</li>
        <li><strong>cb-gcc</strong> contains the workspace and project files for the Linux GCC Compiler.</li>
        <li><strong>cb-intel</strong> contains the workspace and project files for the Linux Intel Compiler.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        There are workspace and project files in each folder. All projects have at least Debug and Release configurations.
        The compiles will link to the wxWidgets shared object libraries. All output will be in the
        &quot;bin&quot; directory.</p>
    <p>
        The following workspace files are available.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>AStyleWx</strong> builds Artistic Style Wx as a single file executable. Artistic Style is compiled and
            linked as a Static Library (astylewx).</li>
        <li><strong>AStyleWxSo</strong> builds the Artistic Style Wx program with Astistic Style compiled and linked as
            a Shared Object Library (astylewxso).
            <ul>
                <li><em>AStyleWxSo</em> uses a <strong>local</strong> Artistic Style shared library. This library is compiled
                    by the workspace. Only this library will be used, system libraries will be ignored.</li>
                <li><em>AStyleWxSoSys</em> uses a <strong>system</strong> Artistic Style shared library. This library must be
                    installed in a system library folder with the correct linkage. The most current library will be used.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        If more than one wxWidgets distribution is installed the default distribution to used. The best way to change
        the default distribution is to use update-alternatives as described in <a href="_wx_wxWidgets_Compiles">Linux 
            wxWidgets Compiles</a>. It can also be changed using the project file's &quot;Custom Variables&quot; 
        option. In the
        menu 
        select Project &gt; Build Options, Custom Variables, and select the project name at the top. The variables apply
        to all targets. <strong>The variable values must correspond to an installed wxWidgets distribution available in 
        wx-config.</strong> The following variables are available.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>WX</strong> indicates the wxWidgets version to use. Use the major and minor version number separated 
            by a dot (e.g. 3.1). If it is not specified the version of the default distribution is used.</li>
        <li><strong>TK</strong> indicates the graphical toolkit to use. The valid entries are gtk2 or gtk3. If it is not 
            specified the toolkit of the default distribution is used.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h4 id="_CMake_Linux">CMake Linux</h4>

    <p>
        Artistic Style Wx has CMake support for GCC, Clang, and Intel compilers. Other compilers will probably work if
        the necessary options are set. Refer to the section on <a href="#_Compiler_Options">Compiler Options</a> for
        more information.</p>
    <p>
        A CMake &quot;out of source&quot;
        build should be used for the different compile configurations. The default build is a release version. A debug
        version must be specifically requested.</p>
    <p>
        If more than one wxWidgets distribution is installed the default distribution to used. The best way to change
        the default distribution is to use update-alternatives as described in <a href="_wx_wxWidgets_Compiles">Linux 
            wxWidgets Compiles</a>. It can also be changed using variable definitions when cmake is executed. <strong>The 
                variable values must correspond to an installed wxWidgets distribution available in wx-config.</strong>
        The following variable definitions are available.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>-DWX=x.y</strong> indicates the wxWidgets version to use. The x and y are the major and minor version
            number separated 
            by a dot (e.g. 3.1). If it is not specified the version of the default distribution is used.</li>
        <li><strong>-DTK=[gtk2, gtk3]</strong> indicates the graphical toolkit to use. The valid entries are gtk2 or gtk3.
            If it is not 
            specified the toolkit of the default distribution is used.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h5>EXAMPLES</h5>

    <p>
        The following examples are assumed to be run from the astyle directory that contains
        CMakeLists.txt. They show out of source builds that generate makefiles.</p>
    <p>
        To build the GCC release version:</p>
    <pre>mkdir  aswx-gcc
cd  aswx-gcc
cmake  ../
make
</pre>
    <p>
        To build the debug version using the Clang compiler:</p>
    <pre>mkdir  aswx-clang
cd  aswx-clang
CXX=clang++  -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug  cmake  ../
make
</pre>
    <p>To change the wxWidgets distribution and GTK toolkit:</p>
    <pre>mkdir  aswx-gcc
cd  aswx-gcc
cmake  -DWX=3.1  -DGTK=gtk3  ../
make
</pre>

    <h5>INSTALL</h5>

    <p>
        There is no install or uninstall. This should be done manually.</p>

    <h4 id="_GCC_Makefile">GCC Makefile</h4>

    <p>
        The build has no autoconf dependency. To build the AStyleWx configurations use the makefile located in
        the astylewx/build/gcc directory. The executables will be in the astylewx/build/gcc/bin directory.
        The Artistic Style source is included in the AStyleWx compile but not in the AStyleWxSo compile. </p>
    <p>
        To build Artistic Style Wx change to the astylewx build/gcc directory. Before the first compile the deps.mak file
        should be regenerated to assure the correct version of wxWidgets headers is being used. It is regenerated using
        the &quot;deps&quot; target in the makefile. Wait for it to finish before doing the make.</p>

    <pre>cd astylewx/build/gcc
make deps
make</pre>

    <p>
        To build the other astylewx configurations you can enter the file name or a symbolic name. Entering "make astylewx"
        or "make release" will build the command line configuration. Following are the symbolic names and file names (in
        parens) of the various configurations:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>release</strong> or <strong>astylewx</strong> builds the Artistic Style Wx command line program. This
            is the default option.</li>
        <li><strong>shared</strong> or <strong>astylewxso</strong> builds the Artistic Style Wx program to use an astyle
            shared library.</li>
        <li><strong>debug</strong> or <strong>astylewxd</strong> builds the Artistic Style Wx command line program with
            debugging information.</li>
        <li><strong>shareddebug</strong> or <strong>astylewxsod</strong> builds the Artistic Style Wx program to use an
            astyle shared library with debugging information.</li>
        <li><strong>all </strong>builds all the above configurations.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        More than one configuration can be built at the same time. For example, to build all the release and shared
		configurations enter:</p>

    <pre>cd astyle/build/gcc
make release shared</pre>

    <p>
        The <a href="#_Makefile_Shared_Libraries">Makefile Shared Libraries</a> section contains additional
        information on compiling to use an astyle shared library. The <a href="#_Other_Makefile_Options">Other Makefile
            Options</a> and <a href="#_Other_Makefile_Targets">Other Makefile Targets</a> sections contain additional
        compile and target options.</p>

    <h4 id="_Clang_Makefile">Clang Makefile</h4>

    <p>
        The build has no autoconf dependency. To build AStyleWx use the makefile located in the astyle/build/clang
        directory. The executables will be in the astyle/build/clang/bin directory.
        The Artistic Style source is included in the AStyleWx compile.</p>

    <p>
        To build Artistic Style Wx change to the astylewx/build/clang directory. Before the first compile the deps.mak
        file should be regenerated to assure the correct version of wxWidgets headers is being used. It is regenerated
        using the &quot;deps&quot; target in the makefile. Wait for it to finish before doing the make.</p>

    <pre>cd astylewx/build/clang
make deps
make
</pre>

    <p>
        The <a href="#_Makefile_Shared_Libraries">Makefile Shared Libraries</a> section contains additional
        information on compiling to use an astyle shared library. The <a href="#_Other_Makefile_Options">Other Makefile
            Options</a> and <a href="#_Other_Makefile_Targets">Other Makefile Targets</a> sections contain additional
        compile and target options.</p>

    <h4 id="_Intel_Makefile">Intel Makefile</h4>

    <p>
        These procedures and the makefile are for recent versions of the compiler. They may not work for earlier versions.
        Instructions for your compiler are in the compiler documentation file "get_started_lc.htm".</p>
    <p>
        To compile the source there are environment variables that must be set by running the compiler environment script
        compilervars.sh (or compilervars.csh) with an argument that specifies the target architecture. If this has not
        been done already enter: "<strong>source &nbsp;&lt;install-dir&gt;/bin/compilervars.sh&nbsp;&lt;arg&gt;</strong>",
        where &lt;install-dir&gt; is the directory where the compiler is installed and &lt;arg&gt; is <strong>ia32 </strong>
        or <strong>intel64</strong>. If this is not done "make" will display an error message. On an Intel x64 platform
        installed in the default directory the instruction would be</p>
    <pre>source /opt/intel/bin/compilervars.sh intel64</pre>
    <p>
        The build has no autoconf dependency. To build AStyleWx use the makefile located in the astyle/build/intel directory.
        The executables will be in the astyle/build/intel/bin directory. The Artistic Style source is included in the
        AStyleWx compile.</p>

    <p>
        To build Artistic Style Wx change to the astylewx/build/intel directory.
        Before the first compile the deps.mak file should be regenerated to assure the correct version of wxWidgets headers
        is being used. It is regenerated using the &quot;deps&quot; target in the makefile. Wait for it to finish before
        doing the make.</p>

    <pre>cd astylewx/build/intel
make deps
make

        <strong>To build the AStyleWxSo program an AStyle shared library must be compiled using the AStyle
            makefile. </strong>AStyleWxSo, the compile using the AStyle dynamic library, uses the compiler directive ASTYLE_DYLIB.
        This does a dynamic load of the AStyle library at runtime, it is NOT linked during the compile. This will allow
        it to ignore the library soname version while loading. The shared library can either be left in the AStyle folder
        or copied to the binary folder containing the AStyleWxSo executable. (It may be in any of the folders indicated
        by the rpaths options in the AStyleWx makefile). If no library is found a message will be displayed a runtime,
        not compile time.</p>
    <p>
        The shared library compile expects to use the current AStyle library as a local library. If you have system
        libraries installed and want to use them, the makefile needs to be changed. Find the Makefile macro
        &quot;$(rpaths)&quot; in the linker command and change it to "&#8209;lastyle". The instruction for the default
        build should be changed in a similar manner. When this is done the compile will link to the most current system
        library. </p>

    <h4 id="_Other_Makefile_Options">Other Makefile Options</h4>

    <p>
        The following additional compile options are available for GCC, Clang, Intel, and MacOS.</p>

    <h5>WX=</h5>
    <pre>WX=3.1</pre>

    <p>
        To compile with a wxWidgets release other than the default use the WX option. For example, if both releases 3.0
        and 3.1 are installed, using WX=3.1 will compile with wxWidgets release 3.1. <strong>The variable values must 
            correspond to an installed wxWidgets distribution available in wx-config.</strong> This option may be used
        with makefile compile and install commands.</p>

    <h5>GTK=</h5>
    <pre>GTK=gtk3</pre>

    <p>
        To compile with a GTK toolkit other than the default use the GTK option. For example, if a wxWidgets release has
        both gtk2 and gtk3 installed, using GTK=gtk3 will compile with the gtk3 oolkit. <strong>The variable values must 
            correspond to an installed wxWidgets distribution available in x-config.</strong> This option may be used
        with makefile compile and install commands.</p>

    <h5>CFLAGS</h5>

    <p>
        To add additional compiler options use CFLAGS. The options should be enclosed in quotes if spaces are
        included.</p>

    <h5>LDFLAGS</h5>

    <p>
        To add additional linker options use LDFLAGS. The options should be enclosed in quotes if spaces are
        included.</p>

    <h5>TESTMODE1</h5>

    <p>
        This is used in CFLAGS to bypass AStyleWx warning messages when changed files have not been saved. Its purpose
        is to make testing more convenient. It is not intended to be used in a release configuration. To use the option
        enter CFLAGS=&quot;&#8209;DTESTMODE1&quot;.</p>

    <h4 id="_Other_Makefile_Targets">Other Makefile Targets</h4>

    <p>
        The following additional makefile targets are available.</p>

    <h5>clean</h5>

    <p>
        Removes the object and executable files for all configurations.</p>
    <p>
        To remove the files for all configurations:</p>

    <pre>make clean
</pre>

    <h5>cleanobj</h5>

    <p>
        Removes the object files for all configurations. The executables will not be removed.</p>
    <p>
        To remove only the object files for all configurations:</p>

    <pre>make cleanobj
</pre>

    <h5>install</h5>

    <p>
        Installs the AStyleWx executable and documentation files. The default is /usr/bin for the executable and /usr/share/doc/astylewx
        for the documentation. You must have the appropriate permissions to use install.</p>
    <p>
        To install AStyleWx to the default directories:</p>
    <pre>sudo make install
</pre>
    <p>
        To install AStyleWx to a different directory, set a value for the macro $(prefix). For example, to install the
        executable to a user's home directory (/home/<i>user</i>/bin):</p>
    <pre>sudo make prefix=$HOME install
</pre>

    <h5>uninstall</h5>

    <p>
        Uninstalls the executable and documentation. You must have the appropriate permissions to use uninstall.</p>
    <p>
        To uninstall AStyleWx from the default directories:</p>
    <pre>sudo make uninstall
</pre>
    <p>
        To uninstall the files from a different directory set a value for the macro $(prefix). For example, to uninstall
        the files from a user's home directory (/home/<i>user</i>):</p>

    <pre>sudo make prefix=$HOME uninstall
</pre>
    <p>
        NOTE: The uninstall option will NOT remove the &quot;.astylewx&quot; configuration files from the user's home
        directory. The files must be removed individually for each user.</p>

    <h3 id="_MacOS_Compiles">MacOS Compiles</h3>

    <h4 id="_Xcode">Xcode</h4>

    <p>
        AStyleWx workspace and project files for the Xcode development environment are available in the
        &quot;build/xcode&quot;
            directory. AStyleWx links AStyle as a static library.</p>
    <p>
        The project files have Debug and Release configurations. The following projects are available in the AStyleWx
        workspace.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>AStyleA</strong> builds the Artistic Style program as a Static Library (libastyle.a). This will be statically
            linked with AStyleWx.</li>
        <li><strong>AStyleWx</strong> builds the AStyleWx program. It will be linked with AStyleA to create the AStyleWx executable.
            This will build AStyleA first if necessary.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        The following projects are available in the AStyleWxDy workspace.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>AStyleDy</strong> builds the Artistic Style program as a dynamic library (libastylexx.dylib). This will
            be dynamically linked with AStyleWxDy at runtime.</li>
        <li><strong>AStyleWxDy</strong> builds the AStyleWx program. It will be dynamically linked with AStyleDy at
            runtime. This will build AStyleDy first if necessary.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Xcode cannot use the wx-config file like the makefile compile. The information for wxWidgets
        headers and libraries must be entered into Xcode. There is information at on doing this at wxWidgets
        <a href="https://wiki.wxwidgets.org/Creating_Xcode_3_projects_for_wxWidgets_applications"
            target="_blank" title="open new window">Creating Xcode 3 projects for wxWidgets applications</a>. A
        description of the process follows.</p>
    <p>
        Display the wx-config default release as described in <a href="#_wx_Linux">Linux wxWidgets Compiles</a>.</p>
    <p>
        Check the following settings for the wxWidgets release you want to use:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>In the Xcode Build Settings, navigate to Search Paths and find Header Search Paths. Change the wxWidgets
        version numbers if they are not correct.</li>
        <li>In the Xcode Build Settings, navigate to Linking and find Other Linker Flags. Change the wxWidgets
        version numbers if they are not correct.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        Build and run the program as usual from Xcode. The linker should be able to find the correct static libraries
        for the wxWidgets version. If there are linker errors check the wx-config settings above.</p>

    <h5>install</h5>

    <p>
        The following instructions are for the AStyleWx applications. The app will be installed in the Applications
        directory. You must have the appropriate permissions to use install.</p>
    <p>
        To install AStyleWx app to the tmp/AStyleWx.dst/Applications directory:</p>

    <pre>cd astylewx/build/xcode
sudo xcodebuild install -project AStyleWx.xcodeproj -target AStyleWx
</pre>

    <h4 id="_CMake_MacOS">CMake MacOS</h4>

    <p>
        Artistic Style Wx has CMake support for MacOS. It is used the same as <a href="#_CMake_Linux">CMake Linux</a>
        except the supported compilers are only GCC and Clang.</p>

    <h4 id="_MacOS_Makefile">MacOS Makefile</h4>

    <p>
        The build has no autoconf dependency. To build the AStyleWx configurations use the makefile located in the astylewx/build/mac
        directory. The executables will be in the astylewx/build/mac/bin directory. The Artistic Style source is included
        in the AStyleWx compile.</p>
    <p>
        To build Artistic Style Wx change to the astylewx build mac directory. Before the first compile the deps.mak
        file should be regenerated to assure the correct version of wxWidgets headers is being used. It is regenerated
        using the &quot;deps&quot; target in the makefile. Wait for it to finish before doing the make.</p>

    <pre>cd astylewx/build/mac
make deps
make</pre>

    <p>
        To build the other astylewx configurations you can enter the file name or a symbolic name. Entering &quot;make
        astylewx&quot; or &quot;make release&quot; will build the command line configuration. Following are the symbolic
        names and file names (in parens) of the various configurations:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>release</strong> or <strong>astylewx</strong> builds the Artistic Style Wx executable. This
            is the default option. </li>
        <li><strong>debug</strong> or <strong>astylewxd</strong> builds the Artistic Style Wx executable with debugging
            information. </li>
        <li><strong>all</strong> builds all the above configurations.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        More than one configuration can be built at the same time. For example, to build all the release configurations
        enter:</p>

    <pre>cd astyle/build/mac
make release debug</pre>

    <p>
        The <a href="#_Other_Makefile_Options">Other Makefile Options</a> and <a href="#_Other_Makefile_Targets">Other
            Makefile Targets</a> sections contain additional compile and target options. They are the same as for Linux
        makefiles.</p>

    <h3 id="_Windows_Compiles">Windows Compiles</h3>

    <h4 id="_Precompiled_Executable">Precompiled Executable</h4>

    <p>
        In addition to the source files, the Windows distribution package contains an Artistic Style Win32 executable
        (AStyle.exe). If you prefer to compile the executable yourself use the following instructions.</p>

    <h4 id="_Visual_C++_Compiler">Visual C++ Compiler</h4>

    <p>
        <strong>To compile AStyleWx the wxWidgetsMacros.props files must be changed.</strong> The files are located in
        the build\vs... folders. The easiest way to change them is to open the props file in a text editor. Then change
        the &quot;WXWIN&quot;" field to the location of the wxWidgets directory on your system. The &quot;wxVersion&quot;
        field will need to be changed if it does not contain the correct wxWidgets two digit version. The &quot;wxVersion3&quot;
        field contains the three digit version number for wxWidgets versions 3.1.1 or greater. Change it if the variable
        is present. </p>
    <p>
        The &quot;wxWidgetsMacros.props&quot; files can also be changed from the &quot;Properties Editor&quot; in Visual
        Studio. An AStyleWx solution must be open. Open the &quot;Property Manager&quot; window from the View
        menu. Open a configuration in the Property Manager, right click on &quot;wxWidgets Macros&quot;, and select &quot;Properties&quot;.
        Under &quot;Common Properties&quot; select &quot;User Macros&quot;. The &quot;WXWIN&quot; and &quot;wxVersion&quot;
        macros values will be displayed. They can be changed by double-clicking on the field name. Change the macro value
        to the correct value for your system and press OK. This will change the macros for all configurations. The properties
        file needs to be saved before closing the solution.</p>
    <p>
        The following solution files are available.</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>AStyleWx_3.x </strong>builds Artistic Style Wx for version 3.x of wxWidgets, where x is the minor
            version number. Artistic Style is compiled and linked as a Static Library (astylelib.lib). The build will result
            in a single file executable.</li>
        <li><strong>AStyleWxDll_3.x </strong>builds the Artistic Style Wx program for version 3.x of wxWidgets, where x is
            the minor version number. Artistic Style is compiled and linked as a Dynamic Link Library (AStyle.dll). This
            will also build an exports library and a static library for linking the dll. </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        All projects have the following configurations available for Win32 and x64 platforms.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Debug</strong> builds a debug configuration that is linked to the wxWidgets static libraries.</li>
        <li><strong>Release</strong> builds a release configuration that is linked to the wxWidgets static
            libraries.</li>
        <li><strong>DLL Debug</strong> builds a debug configuration that is linked to the wxWidgets DLL libraries.</li>
        <li><strong>DLL Release</strong> builds a release configuration that is linked to the wxWidgets DLL
            libraries.</li>
        <li><strong>Static</strong> builds a release configuration that is linked to the wxWidgets static libraries
            and is also linked to a static runtime library.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        To compile a configuration, the corresponding library files must be available in the wxWidgets directory. All
        library file compiles are available in the wxWidgets solution files except the Static compile. If the Static
        compile is not needed it can be removed from the configurations. If you want to try compiling it the procedure
        described in the AStyleWx documentation <a href="static.html"
            target="_blank" title="open new window">Visual Studio Static Compile</a>.</p>

    <h4 id="_CodeBlocks_Windows">CodeBlocks Windows</h4>

    <p>
        There are build folders for the following compilers. All compiler folders are in the &quot;build&quot; directory.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>cb-mingw</strong> contains the workspace and project files for the MinGW or TDM_GCC Compilers.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        There are workspace and project files for each compiler. All projects have at least Debug and Release configurations.
        Output will be in the &quot;bin&quot; directory.</p>
    <p>
        The following workspace files are available.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>AStyleWx</strong>&nbsp;builds Artistic Style Wx as a single file executable. Artistic Style is compiled
            and linked as a Static Library (AStyle.dll).</li>
        <li><strong>AStyleWxSo</strong>&nbsp;builds the Artistic Style Wx program with Artistic Style is compiled and linked
            as a Dynamic Link Library (AStyleWxDll).
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        <strong>To compile AStyleWx the project file&#39;s &quot;Custom Variables&quot; options must be changed.</strong>
        In the menu select Project &gt; Build Options, Custom Variables, and select the project name at the top. The variables
        apply to all targets. All of the variables must be changed to the correct values.</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>WXWIN</strong> is the location of the wxWidgets directory on your system.</li>
        <li><strong>wxVersion</strong> is the two digit wxWidgets version being compiled, without a separating dot (e.g. 
            31). </li>
        <li><strong>wxVersion3</strong> is the three digit wxWidgets version being compiled, without separating dots (e.g.
            311).</li>
    </ul>

    <h4 id="_CMake_Windows">CMake Windows</h4>

    <p>
        Artistic Style Wx has CMake support for the MinGW compiler only.</p>
    <p>
        Since the different builds use the same source files an &quot;out of source&quot; build should be used. The
        default build for MinGW is a release version. A debug version must be specifically requested. </p>
    <p>
        The build must get compile information from variables passed to CMake. <strong>These variables may be set by a &quot;set&quot;
            command before running CMake, or by changing the information in the CMakeLists.txt script.</strong> The variables
        are at the beginning of the script. The following must be set.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>WXWIN</strong> is the path to the wxWidgets top level folder. The folder contains directories for the
            include files and the library files used in the build.</li>
        <li><strong>WXSHARED</strong> is a boolean value that indicates if the shared libraries (DLLs) are to be used instead
            of the static libraries. The default is to use the static libraries. If shared libraries are used, the shared
            libraries are copied to the folder with the executable so the program can be executed.</li>
    </ul>

    <h5>EXAMPLES</h5>

    <p>
        The following examples are assumed to be run from the directory that contains
        CMakeLists.txt. They show out of source builds that generate makefiles. </p>
    <p>
        A path to the compiler executable may need to be declared before compiling. To set the variables before compiling,
        replace the fillowing path name with the path on your computer.</p>
    <pre>set PATH=C:\Program Files\CMake\bin;%PATH%
</pre>
    <p>
        To build the MinGW release version using static libraries:</p>
    <pre>md  aswx-mingw
cd  aswx-mingw
cmake  -G "MinGW Makefiles"  -DWXWIN=&quot;C:/Programs/wxWidgets-3.0.2_mingw&quot;
mingw32-make</pre>

    <p>
        To build the MinGW debug version using shared libraries:</p>
    <pre>md  aswx-mingw
cd  aswx-mingw
cmake  -G "MinGW Makefiles"  -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug  -DWXSHARED=1  -DWXWIN=&quot;C:/Programs/wxWidgets-3.0.2_mingw&quot;
mingw32-make</pre>

    <h5>INSTALL</h5>

    <p>
        There is no install or uninstall. This must be done manually.</p>

    <h3 id="_Other_Compilers">Other Compilers</h3>

    <p>
        To use other compilers a project file must be built using an editor or development environment.</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Create a project using the compiler development environment.</li>
        <li>Add to the project all the AStyleWx .cpp and .h files in the "src" and &quot;dialog&quot; directories.</li>
        <li>Add to the project all the AStyle .cpp and .h files in the &quot;AStyle\src&quot; directory.</li>
        <li>Define the Preprocessor Definition ASTYLE_LIB for all Configurations and Platforms.</li>
        <li>The Compiler Options section discusses the compiler options to use.</li>
        <li>Compile.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        The AStyle source can also be compiled as a separate static library and linked to the AStyleWx compile.</p>

    <h3 id="_Compiler_Options">Compiler Options</h3>

    <p>
        To compile AStyle as a static or shared (dynamic) library define the macro ASTYLE_LIB. To compile a Java shared
        (dynamic) library define the macro ASTYLE_JNI. The option ASTYLE_NO_EXPORTS is sometimes needed for static libraries
        to prevent compiler error and warning messages. Use the appropriate compiler and linker options to compile the
        static or shared library. Add debug options to compile the debug versions.</p>
    <p>
        Artistic Style Wx has two compiler options. ASTYLE_DYLIB uses the wxWidgets wxDynamicLibrary Class to load an
        AStyle dll at runtime. The AStyle library is NOT linked with AStyleWx. It is loaded at runtime and must be
        available where expected. The TESTMODE1 option can be used with debug builds of AStyleWx. It removes
        confirmation messages for file saves and adds a &quot;Test Options&quot; dialog box to the Tools menu. It cannot
        be used with release builds.</p>
    <p>
        Artistic Style is a small program and it is best to optimize for speed. The debug configurations are not usually
        optimized. To optimize for speed in the release configurations, use the macro NDEBUG to remove asserts. If
        necessary, use an option to activate the C++11 standards (--std=c++11 on GCC and MinGW). Use an option that allows
        inline function expansion. Runtime Type Information (RTTI) is NOT needed. Exceptions are not used. Use whole program
        optimization if your compiler supports it. There may be other options you can use depending
        on the compiler.</p>
